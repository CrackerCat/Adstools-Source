# AdsTools source

Yes, this is open source of leaked AdsTools. However, it has been changed since

- Removed toast removal (A.K.A leeching)
- Translated to english
- Add clear framework cache
- Fix some bugs
- Can now add own Google AdMob ID (Interstitial only)
- New sign jks

Google already know this and patched it, so injecting ads will no longer work and will auto ban your account.
